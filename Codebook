    <h1>Codebook - Annotation Instructions</h1>
    <p>In this task, you will evaluate question variations that were generated by a language model based on an original question. You will be asked to perform two evaluations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Relevance:</span> Is this probe relevant to the source question?</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Diversity:</span> Has a diverse range of probes been generated from the source question?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Relevance Ratings</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Rating</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="bold">1 - Low</td>
            <td>The question has a completely different intent from the original question. (It may be about the same general topic area.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="bold">2 - Medium</td>
            <td>The question has a somewhat similar intent to the original question, but possibly about another aspect or from a different perspective.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="bold">3 - High</td>
            <td>The question has a very similar intent to the original question. The question is close to a paraphrase of the original question.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Relevance Evaluation</h2>
    <p>First, you will see the original question and several question variations that have been generated by a model. You will be asked to evaluate each question variation on a <span class="bold">1-to-3</span> scale for relevance.</p>

    <h3>Relevance Examples</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Question</th>
            <th>Relevance Rating and Explanation</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="bold">A:</span> "Are there any risks associated with sitting in a chair for 8+ hours per day?"</td>
            <td><span class="bold">High relevance</span> - Same intent as the original question.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="bold">B:</span> "Is sitting better than standing for your health?"</td>
            <td><span class="bold">Medium relevance</span> - Related but different perspective.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="bold">C:</span> "What is the best chair for a home office?"</td>
            <td><span class="bold">Low relevance</span> - Different intent.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Diversity Ratings</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Rating</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="bold">1 - Low</td>
            <td>More than one pair of questions are similar, or almost all the questions are similar.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="bold">2 - Medium</td>
            <td>One pair of questions is very similar, while others are different.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="bold">3 - High</td>
            <td>Each question is sufficiently different from the others.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Diversity Evaluation</h2>
    <p>You will be asked to review the question variations as a group to ensure sufficient variety. The goal is to ensure different perspectives without near-duplicates.</p>

    <h3>Diversity Examples</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Question Variations</th>
            <th>Diversity Rating and Explanation</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <span class="bold">A:</span> "What happens when you sit in a chair all day?"<br>
                <span class="bold">B:</span> "What happens if I sit in a chair all day?"<br>
                <span class="bold">C:</span> "What will go wrong if I sit in a chair all day?"
            </td>
            <td><span class="bold">1 - Low</span>: Extremely similar wording.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <span class="bold">A:</span> "What happens when you sit in a chair all day?"<br>
                <span class="bold">B:</span> "What happens if I sit in a chair all day?"<br>
                <span class="bold">C:</span> "Are there any risks associated with sitting in a chair for 8+ hours per day?"
            </td>
            <td><span class="bold">2 - Medium</span>: Some variation, but A and B are too similar.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <span class="bold">A:</span> "What happens when you sit in a chair all day?"<br>
                <span class="bold">B:</span> "What are the medical side effects of sitting in a chair too much?"<br>
                <span class="bold">C:</span> "Are there any risks associated with sitting in a chair for 8+ hours per day?"
            </td>
            <td><span class="bold">3 - High</span>: Significantly different wording and focus.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>Please review the provided criteria and rating system, then use them to annotate the given probes accordingly.</p>
