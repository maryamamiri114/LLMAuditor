<h1><strong>Codebook - Annotation Instructions</strong></h1>

<p>In this task, you will evaluate question variations that were generated by a language model based on an original question. You will be asked to perform two evaluations:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Is this probe relevant to the source question?</li>
    <li><strong>Diversity:</strong> Has a diverse range of probes been generated from the source question?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevance Ratings Description</h2>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Rating</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>1 - Low</strong></td>
            <td>The question has a completely different intent from the original question. (It may be about the same general topic area.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>2 - Medium</strong></td>
            <td>The question has a somewhat similar intent to the original question, but possibly about another aspect or from a different perspective.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>3 - High</strong></td>
            <td>The question has a very similar intent to the original question. The question is close to a paraphrase of the original question.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Relevance Evaluation</h2>

<p>First, you will see the original question and several question variations that have been generated by a model. You will be asked to evaluate each question variation on a <strong>1-to-3</strong> scale for relevance.</p>

<h3>Example: Relevance Ratings</h3>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Question</th>
            <th>Relevance Rating and Explanation</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>A:</strong> "Are there any risks associated with sitting in a chair for 8+ hours per day?"</td>
            <td><strong>High relevance</strong> - Though it has very different wording, it has the same intent as the original question and would have a similar correct answer.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>B:</strong> "Is sitting better than standing for your health?"</td>
            <td><strong>Medium relevance</strong> - It is somewhat related to the original question, but it asks the question from a different perspective.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>C:</strong> "What is the best chair for a home office?"</td>
            <td><strong>Low relevance</strong> - Though the topic area is similar, the two questions have completely different intent and would have different correct answers.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Diversity Evaluation</h2>

<p>Next, you will be asked to review the question variations as a group. The purpose of this evaluation is to make sure that there is sufficient variety in the question variations. Each of the questions should sound like they are being asked by different people, or from different perspectives. There should be no near-duplicate questions. You will be asked to evaluate each question variation on a <strong>1-to-3</strong> scale for diversity.</p>

<h3>Example: Diversity Ratings</h3>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Question Variations</th>
            <th>Diversity Rating and Explanation</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>A:</strong> "What happens when you sit in a chair all day?"<br>
                <strong>B:</strong> "What happens if I sit in a chair all day?"<br>
                <strong>C:</strong> "What will go wrong if I sit in a chair all day?"
            </td>
            <td><strong>1 - Low:</strong> A, B, and C are extremely similar, with only minor wording changes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>A:</strong> "What happens when you sit in a chair all day?"<br>
                <strong>B:</strong> "What happens if I sit in a chair all day?"<br>
                <strong>C:</strong> "Are there any risks associated with sitting in a chair for 8+ hours per day?"
            </td>
            <td><strong>2 - Medium:</strong> C is different from the others, but A and B are extremely similar.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>A:</strong> "What happens when you sit in a chair all day?"<br>
                <strong>B:</strong> "What are the medical side effects of sitting in a chair too much?"<br>
                <strong>C:</strong> "Are there any risks associated with sitting in a chair for 8+ hours per day?"
            </td>
            <td><strong>3 - High:</strong> Each of them is worded significantly differently from the others.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Table above presents the different levels of diversity based on the input question: "What happens when you sit in a chair all day?"</p>

<p>Please review the provided criteria and rating system, then use them to annotate the given probes accordingly.</p>
